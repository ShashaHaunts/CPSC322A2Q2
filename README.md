# CPSC322A2Q2

This program consists of five files: MyList, MyQueue, MyStack, Node, and Main. These are all written in Java. The Node class is what we use to represent each node in the graph - each with attributes to see other nodes they point to and what nodes point to this node. The MyList class is a parent class to the classes MyStack and MyQueue. Because these two classes have the same parent type, we are able to use polymorphism to ensure that the search method is unaware of which search it is performing. MyStack performs a DFS by removing Nodes from the frontier by popping them off the top of a stack.  MyQueue performs BFS by using a first-in-first-out implementation via an ArrayDequeue. Program output (nodes expanded and which solution paths were returned) for both DFS and BFS can be found at the bottom of this question.
